--------------
To develop the system you've described—a scalable, AI-powered Chrome extension integrated with a backend using React.js, Node.js, and AI services like OpenAI's GPT and Whisper—let's break it down step-by-step. Below is a high-level guide on how to approach this project with the necessary technologies and a sample codebase for each part of the system.
Project Structure Overview:

    Frontend:
        React.js for building the user interface (UI).
        Mantine for UI components (it’s a modern React component library).
        HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript (ES6+) for structuring and styling the app.
        Chrome extension functionalities (content scripts, background scripts).

    Backend:
        Node.js & Express.js to build the backend server.
        MongoDB/PostgreSQL for database storage.
        AI integration with OpenAI APIs (GPT for text generation, Whisper for transcription).

    DevOps:
        CI/CD pipelines for continuous integration/deployment (using tools like GitLab CI, CircleCI, Jenkins).
        AWS/GCP for cloud hosting, depending on your infrastructure preference.
        Jira for task and project management.
        Git for version control.

Step 1: Setting up the Chrome Extension

    Manifest File (manifest.json) The manifest.json is the configuration file for the Chrome extension. This file tells Chrome how to load your extension, which permissions it needs, and which scripts to run.

{
  "manifest_version": 2,
  "name": "AI Content Extractor & Rewriter",
  "version": "1.0",
  "permissions": [
    "activeTab",
    "storage",
    "https://api.openai.com/*"
  ],
  "background": {
    "scripts": ["background.js"],
    "persistent": false
  },
  "content_scripts": [
    {
      "matches": ["<all_urls>"],
      "js": ["content.js"]
    }
  ],
  "browser_action": {
    "default_popup": "popup.html",
    "default_icon": "icon.png"
  },
  "icons": {
    "16": "icon16.png",
    "48": "icon48.png",
    "128": "icon128.png"
  }
}

    Background Script (background.js) This script listens for messages from content scripts or the popup. It handles API calls to the backend and processes tasks asynchronously.

chrome.runtime.onInstalled.addListener(() => {
  console.log("AI Content Extractor Extension Installed.");
});

chrome.browserAction.onClicked.addListener((tab) => {
  // Can handle background tasks like sending data to backend, etc.
  chrome.tabs.executeScript(tab.id, { file: "content.js" });
});

    Content Script (content.js) The content script will interact with the web page’s DOM. It can extract text, images, or any other content and send it to the background script or API.

const selectedText = window.getSelection().toString();  // Get selected text on page

// Send the selected content to the backend for AI processing
chrome.runtime.sendMessage({
  action: "processContent",
  data: selectedText
}, function(response) {
  console.log('Processed content:', response);
});

Step 2: Backend Development

For the backend, you'll use Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB (or PostgreSQL) for handling requests from the Chrome extension and storing/retrieving data. You’ll integrate OpenAI's GPT-3 API for text generation and Whisper for transcription.

    Setting Up the Express Server (server.js)

const express = require("express");
const axios = require("axios");
const bodyParser = require("body-parser");
const app = express();
const port = 3000;

app.use(bodyParser.json());

app.post("/processText", async (req, res) => {
  const { data } = req.body;

  // Example: Sending to OpenAI API (Text Generation using GPT-3)
  try {
    const response = await axios.post(
      "https://api.openai.com/v1/completions",
      {
        model: "text-davinci-003",
        prompt: `Rewrite this content: ${data}`,
        max_tokens: 100
      },
      {
        headers: {
          Authorization: `Bearer YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY`
        }
      }
    );

    res.json({ processedText: response.data.choices[0].text.trim() });
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(error);
    res.status(500).json({ error: "Failed to process text" });
  }
});

app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`Server listening on port ${port}`);
});

    Setting Up MongoDB (for user data storage)

const mongoose = require('mongoose');
const uri = "mongodb://localhost:27017/ai_content";  // Use MongoDB URI

mongoose.connect(uri, { useNewUrlParser: true, useUnifiedTopology: true });

const userSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  username: String,
  contentHistory: [String]  // Storing history of processed content
});

const User = mongoose.model('User', userSchema);

    Handling Whisper API (for transcription)

Whisper is a speech-to-text model by OpenAI. You can use it for transcribing audio. Here’s how you can integrate it:

const whisper = require('whisper-async');  // Hypothetical Whisper client

app.post("/transcribeAudio", async (req, res) => {
  const { audioFile } = req.body;
  
  try {
    const transcription = await whisper.transcribe(audioFile);
    res.json({ transcription });
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(error);
    res.status(500).json({ error: "Failed to transcribe audio" });
  }
});

Step 3: Frontend Development (React.js + Mantine)

The frontend will display the dashboard where users can view processed content and manage their settings.

    React App Setup

npx create-react-app ai-dashboard
cd ai-dashboard
npm install mantine axios

    Dashboard (React Component)

import React, { useState } from "react";
import { Button, Textarea, Container, Text } from "@mantine/core";
import axios from "axios";

const Dashboard = () => {
  const [selectedText, setSelectedText] = useState("");
  const [processedText, setProcessedText] = useState("");

  const handleTextProcess = async () => {
    try {
      const response = await axios.post("http://localhost:3000/processText", {
        data: selectedText
      });
      setProcessedText(response.data.processedText);
    } catch (error) {
      console.error("Error processing text:", error);
    }
  };

  return (
    <Container>
      <Text>Select content and paste it here:</Text>
      <Textarea
        value={selectedText}
        onChange={(e) => setSelectedText(e.target.value)}
        placeholder="Paste your content here"
      />
      <Button onClick={handleTextProcess}>Process Content</Button>
      <Text mt="md">Processed Content:</Text>
      <Textarea value={processedText} readOnly />
    </Container>
  );
};

export default Dashboard;

    Connecting Backend with React (API Call)

React’s Axios will be used to send content to the backend and receive processed results. When a user selects text on a website and pastes it into the dashboard, it’s sent to the backend for AI processing (using GPT-3 or Whisper for transcription).
Step 4: Deploying the Solution

    CI/CD Pipeline (GitHub Actions / Jenkins):
        Set up automated pipelines for testing, building, and deploying both the backend and the Chrome extension.

    Cloud Hosting (AWS / GCP):
        Deploy your Node.js server on cloud services like AWS or GCP.
        You can use AWS Lambda for serverless deployment or EC2 instances for more control.

Step 5: Documentation

Document the process thoroughly in Confluence, which includes:

    Technical documentation for developers.
    API documentation for backend services.
    User guides for using the extension, backend services, and React dashboard.
    Deployment instructions for both backend and frontend systems.

Conclusion

This solution provides a scalable, AI-powered Chrome extension with backend integrations using OpenAI APIs and a modern React.js dashboard. By following these steps, you’ll have a fully functional, user-friendly system that can handle content extraction, rewriting, and transcription. Ensure continuous testing, optimization, and collaboration with your team throughout the process.
